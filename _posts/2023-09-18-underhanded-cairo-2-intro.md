As promised on Twitter, [here's the vulerable contract](https://github.com/milancermak/ltoken).

It's a proof of concept, but I tried to make it so that it resembles an actual contract, so there's more than just the bare minimum for a PoC.


~~[Please DM](https://twitter.com/cairopractice) for hints and solutions. I will post the detailed breakdown of the vulenrability on this blog in a week's time (2023-09-25).~~

Happy hunting.
